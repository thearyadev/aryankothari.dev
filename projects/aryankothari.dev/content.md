# My personal website: aryankothari.dev
Creating a website to be an outline of myself has been on my to-do list for a very long time. You may be thinking, something this important should be a higher priority. This is true, and you would be right. 

I'm a backend developer primarily, creating something visually appealing is difficult and wasn't a part of my skillset for a long time. This changed recently, when i began to explore CSS (primarily though [TailwindCSS](https://tailwind.com)) and frontend frameworks (React and NextJS). Working with these tools changed my perspective on frontend web development, and eventually lead me to create this site. 

## Getting Started
Moving forward with this project took a lot of sitting back and thinking. What do I want from the website? How extravagant should it be? I ultimately decided on a few criteria: 

1. It should be simple
2. Support for a "post" style content management
3. Me.

With this in mind, I decided to make a microscopic HTML site. It loads a HTML page, with some javascript that requests the markdown files from the server. Its exactly what the project needed, but that wasn't exactly the objective. The criteria made it clear what the project should be, but the hard part was making it "me". 

## Me
What is me? I have no sense of design. 

Where a real web developer would spend hours in Figma planning and experimenting with layouts and color pallets, I opened Neovim and started writing some plain CSS. The result is the website you see here today. 

Could it have been better? Yes. I could have used some bloated UI library and made a 10/10 visually appealing and interactive site, but that left the scope of the project: Simple.

## Lessons
So what's the point? 

I spent months thinking about this. I thought about ways to impress my visitors with a spectacular experience on the web, but the entire time i was missing the point. That is not *me*. This site is a blog, my blog, and it should represent me. 

Working on this project I learned that functionality is sometimes more important than bells and whistles.
